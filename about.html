        <h1 class="about-title">MY STORY SO FAR...</h1>
        <p class="about-text">My interest in design started as a child when I discovered my Aunt’s Architectural Digest Magazines and Ikea catalogs. I always thought that I wanted to be an interior designer but I ended up taking Management Information Systems as my major because I liked computer programming and I was good at it. For our final project in software development, our group won Best in Design and Packaging.</p>

        <p class="about-text">In my first job after college, I was in charge of the company’s newsletter and magazine layout. That experience solidified that my passion was in design.</p>

        <p class="about-text">For a decade, I worked in the marketing and advertising industry designing collaterals and learning about branding. I learned how to have an eye for detail and be mindful of visual hierarchy. I collaborated with marketing managers and constantly dealt with tight deadlines.</p>

        <p class="about-text">As a designer, I want to grow into something more, which is why I transitioned to UX design. I want to learn and evolve in order to keep up with the neverending updates in technology.  Learning about the UX design process and reading the book “Sprint” by Jake Knapp changed my life and changed how I looked at Design.</p>

        <p class="about-text">My favorite part of UX research is getting to know the users, their needs and their frustrations. I want to be able to create designs that will solve the user’s problems and make their lives better. My experience in UI design makes me a more rounded UX designer and learning about UX design helped me design better user interfaces that are not just focused on aesthetics but are first and foremost user-centered.</p>

        <p class="about-text">I am both creative and analytical. I am detail-oriented and I take pride in producing a quality product. I create designs that engaging, simple and clean.</p>

        <p class="about-text">I believe that learning is a lifelong process. The moment that we stop asking questions because we think we know everything is the point where we begin to stagnate.</p>

        <p class="about-text">In my free time, I like to garden and take care of my indoor plants. I am an adventurous eater who loves to cook. I especially like Asian food and anything spicy. </p>
