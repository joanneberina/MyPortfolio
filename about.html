                    <p>My interest in design started as a child when I discovered my Aunt’s Architectural Digest Magazines and Ikea catalogs. My fascination with it led me to want to be an interior designer. My goal of taking Interior Design didn't work out so I ended up taking Management Information Systems as my major. But during my first job off of college, I somehow ended up doing design work which is what I was really passionate about. For a decade, I worked in the marketing and advertising industry designing collaterals and learning about branding. I learned to be mindful of visual hierarchy and have an eye for detail. I collaborated with marketing managers and constantly dealt with tight deadlines.</p>
            
                    <p>When design started to become more digital. I knew I had to adapt and learn web design. In my journey of learning web design, I stumbled upon "UX Design" and liked what I discovered. It is kind of like a marriage between creativity and logic, and as I am both creative and analytical I thought that it was a good fit. The design process fascinated me and being someone who thrives on structure, UX design really spoke to me. I like designs that are engaging, simple and clean. Some of my favorite books are “Sprint” by Jake Knapp, “Lean UX” by Jeff Gothelf and Josh Sneiden and “Hacking Growth” by Sean Ellis and Morgan Brown.</p>
                                    
                    <p>In my free time, I like to garden and take care of my indoor plants. I am an adventurous eater who loves to cook. I especially like Asian food and anything spicy.</p>
