            <p>
              My fascination with design started as a child when I discovered my aunt’s pile of old Architectural Digest
              and Ikea catalogues. I would spend entire afternoons studying the way these photographed interiors came to
              life, learning how to really "see" a room while internalizing the language of visual hierarchy and
              developing an eye for detail.

              When the world started to digitize and the impact of design became increasingly pixelated, I knew I had to
              adapt. In learning web design, I stumbled upon "UX Design" and liked its dizzying mixture of creativity
              and logic—as a thinker who fluidly toggles between the creative and the analytical, this field fit me like
              a well-worn glove. For a decade prior, I had worked in marketing and advertising designing collaterals and
              branding assets. I collaborated with marketing managers and constantly dealt with tight deadlines. UX
              design’s structured process spoke to me in a way no profession ever had before, and I have further refined
              my taste in digital designs that are engaging, simple and clean. Some of my favorite books are "Sprint" by
              Jake Knapp, "Lean UX" by Jeff Gothelf & Josh Sneiden, and "Hacking Growth" by Sean Ellis & Morgan Brown.

              In my free time, I like to garden and take care of my indoor plants. I am an adventurous eater who loves
              to cook, especially Asian food and anything spicy.
