            <p>
              My fascination with design started in high school when I discovered my aunt’s pile of Architectural Digest
              and Ikea catalogues. I would spend entire afternoons studying these photographed interiors and admiring
              how a room was curated, studying how colors are used and combined.
            </p>
            <p>
              Even though I didn’t fulfill my dream to become an Interior designer, I still chose design as a career
              path. I worked as a graphic designer in marketing and advertising companies, designing collaterals and
              branding assets. I collaborated with marketing managers and constantly dealt with tight deadlines. When
              the world started to digitize, I knew I had to adapt. And while learning web design, I stumbled upon "UX
              Design" and loved its mixture of creativity and logic—as a thinker who fluidly toggles between the
              creative and the analytical, this field fit me like a well-worn glove. UX design’s structured process
              spoke to me in a way no profession ever had before, and I have further refined my taste in designing
              experiences that are engaging, simple and clean. Some of my favorite books are "Sprint" by Jake Knapp,
              "Lean UX" by Jeff Gothelf & Josh Sneiden, and "Hacking Growth" by Sean Ellis & Morgan Brown.

              In my free time, I like to garden and take care of my indoor plants. I am an adventurous eater who loves
              to cook, especially Asian food and anything spicy.
