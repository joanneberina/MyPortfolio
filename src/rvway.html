            Motorhomes, RVs, campervans are all-purpose vehicles that take you where you want to go and give you a place
            to stay along the way. Recreational vehicles or RVs for short, represent adventure, the open road, and
            independence. In the U.S. they are getting more and more popular as these vehicles start to come with more
            modern conveniences.
          </p>
          <p>
            When I started working on the project, I knew very little about the RV industry since RVs are not common
            where I grew up. My first impression was that this was a very niche market. The trends and statistics that
            I’ve gathered from the RV Industry Association (rvia.org) were eye-opening.

            The existing app is intended to generate a route that is safe for RVs after users input their vehicle’s
            specification but the core functionality which is the navigation was broken. The user interface was also not
            intuitive. It wasn’t clear what the user was supposed to do first when they get to the map page. Navigating
            the app can be confusing and overall, the existing solution was just not usable.

          </div>
          <p>
            It became clear that we would have to totally redesign the user interface. Overhauling a product’s entire UI
            in 8 weeks or less is no small feat. Knowing that improvement is a never-ending process and to keep
            ourselves on track, we focused on the following goals:
          </p>

          <ul>
            <li>Provide the most efficient and safe route for users who drive their RV's around</li>
            <li>Give users the most accurate intel based on their details and preferences</li>
            <li>Continuously improve the routing function through additional data sources and crowd-sourced data</li>
            <li>Provide users with a simple and beautiful app design to yield a better RV traveling experience</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            My partner and I wanted to engage our entire team in our process early on. This not only helped build
            camaraderie, but it also helped our developers and data scientists understand what we, as UX designers, were
            contributing to the team. They were so excited when we asked them to join us for a brainstorming workshop!
          </p>
          <p>
            During this workshop, we worked as a team to create initial survey questions, and asked how might we achieve
            our goals?

            Talking to our target users was very insightful, we learned a wealth of invaluable information. To

            We learned that people driving an RV think about things that wouldn’t normally be a concern for a person
            driving a regular vehicle. We went through all the responses and organized it into painpoints and wants.

        </div>
        <div class="section-content">
          <p>
            Based on the user’s painpoints and wants, we designed an initial solution which was a native mobile app that
            had all the bells and whistles - basically the same features as Google maps but for RVs. It had an option to
            search for a point of interest as a destination, add stops along the route, it has geo-location and
            autocomplete. And of course a turn-by-turn voice navigation feature.
          </p>
          <!-- Illustration -->
          <div class="figure">

            </div>
          </div>
          <p>
            But this solution had a lot of challenges because we later found out that we didn’t have the resources to
            get the right API which would provide the data for the points of interest. While all the initial features
            that we wanted were certainly “nice to haves”, it didn’t really directly impact the problem of safely
            routing the RV traveler from point A to point B.

          <p>
            In a perfect world, providing all of these features and addressing all of the user’s painpoints would be
            ideal. But we had to take into account the complexity of the implementation, timeframe, and available
            resources and all the while, setting a reasonable goal for our product releases. We went back to our
            research data and found some useful insights that gave us a clearer direction.

          <div class="highlight">
            <p>
              Painpoint #1:<br />
              “The fastest route is not always the best route.”
            </p>
          </div>
          <p>
            Directions that are provided by other web mapping services is usually the fastest route which is oftentimes,
            not RV-friendly. The most common painpoint for people travelling in an RV is that they are afraid of getting
            into an accident. Safety is the number one concern for people traveling in RVs.
          </p>
          <div class="highlight">
            <p>
              Painpoint #2:<br />
              “My biggest fear while driving in an RV is getting into an accident.”
            </p>
          </div>
          <p>
            Another roadblock was the implementation of a turn by turn voice navigation was not technologically feasible
            given the our time frame. To top it all off, we were not going to build a native mobile app but instead, a
            desktop web app that is mainly used for planning. It was like we went from envisioning to build something
            like Google maps to building something like map quest.
          </p>
          <p>
            So we shifted our focus back to the core functionality of the app which is navigating the user away from low
            bridges with their RV’s specifications. We thought of ways on how we can improve the existing experience and
            really address the user’s painpoint which is safety.
          </p>
          <p>
            We also wanted to validate if users will use this navigation app for planning their routes ahead. We had
            doubts if users will even use a navigation app if it doesn’t have a guided voice prompt, so in our
            succeeding surveys and interviews we included the question:
          </p>
          <p>
            We also wanted to validate if there was still a use-case for a navigation app that is mainly used for
            planning. We had doubts if users will even use a navigation app if it doesn’t have a guided voice prompt, so
            in our succeeding surveys and interviews we included the question:
          </p>
          <!-- Text highlight -->
          <div class="highlight">
            <p>
              “When using a navigation app, is turn by turn voice navigation a necessity to your routing experience?”
            </p>
            <div class="yes-no">
              <div class="yes">
                <h3>YES</h3>

              </div>
            </div>
          </div>
          <p>
            There really wasn’t a huge gap between the people who said YES and NO. But when we looked at the qualitative
            data, a common response was that proper planning is key to a safe and successful RV trip. A seasoned RV
            driver will take the time to plan before a big trip. They would decide on what roads and highways to take,
            where to get gas, stop for the night and so on. Tips like using a checklist document for all essential
            supplies is also one of the planning tools being utilized in the RV communities on Facebook. Therefore we
            assumed that there was a use case for it.

            We made the user interface more intuitive and easy to use by designing a clean and simple look since our
            average demographic is older, who might not be tech-savvy. We also used a more conversational language and
            avoided jargon and labels that might be confusing. And to save on production time, the redesigned sidebar
            requires none to minimal refactoring when converted to mobile.

            Having users set up and save their vehicle profile is a crucial part of generating a route that is custom to
            their RVs. On the add a vehicle form, we fixed how the labels and fields are laid out in a much clearer

            This was a surprising discovery for us and one that we didn’t really expect. It was a typical case of “you
            are not your user.” For the internet savvy generation, this might be a typical element of interaction but
            for our demographic, it was an unfamiliar symbol. The first symbol that we used was not the usual
            bread-meat-bread hamburger menu. We found that our users didn’t really know what the symbol meant. It also
            kind of looked like a logo so they didn’t know to click on it that‘s why we went back to the typical equal
            horizontal lines.

            Instead of showing just a list of the name of the vehicles that the user would need to click for them to see
            the details, we designed an interaction where all the details can be shown and hidden by
            expanding/collapsing each vehicle without going to another page.

            To help users remember what vehicle that they are routing with, we added some sort of breadcrumb so they can
            see the vehicle they are using for that route. It was also important to show the obstacles that are being
            avoided like low clearances and dirt roads so that the user is aware of the value they get when they use the
            app.

            When in doubt about how much the user will understand something or care about a certain feature, get their
            feedback and validate ideas. We would initialy rely on our assumptions but without validation from users, we
            might end up with a product that users are not gonna love or worse, not use at all. Users will always have a
            different perspective of what is useful and what is not.

            involved our developers more with the ideation process or if we got feedback early on before we did a ton of
            work, we would have made informed design decisions because we would know if the solution we were designing
            can even be implemented or if the resources that are required are available.

              “The drive is not always about the destination. The sights in between are just as interesting. There’s
              lots of help finding where to go, but not the best way to get there in an RV”

            This quote from one of our interviewees really stuck with me. Traveling in an RV, like life, (and UX!) is
            not necessarily about the destination. The journey is just as valuable, and the fastest route is not always
            the best option. There’s something to be said for choosing the road less traveled. You never know what
            adventures you’ll find along the way!
