            DocuMentor is an electronic visit verification (EVV) solution used to verify visit activity for home health,
            home care and hospice.
          </p>
          <p>
            Electronic Visit Verification is a system for tracking work performed, hours, notes, accurate location
            information and much more about the patient-caregiver interaction, including information about the service
            provider. EVV applies to care and health services rendered in the home. The purpose of EVV is to ensure that
            services are delivered to people needing those services and that providers only bill for services rendered.

            Caregivers are not using the web app to clock their hours and record notes on the day of their workday but
            instead they are recording their hours and notes at a later date on paper which can be inaccurate and is
            sometimes submitted after the deadline. This makes it harder for providers and supervisors to track the
            caregiverâ€™s hours which can cause delays on billing and reimbursement.

              Both the CEO and the development team suggested that a UI redesign is needed. When I was evaluating the
              current state of the app, it was apparent that the dashboard for both the caregiver and admin didn't have
              a clear visual hierarchy. For example, there were icons that did not have the affordance that it is
              clickable. It also did not have a text label which makes it unclear what it is for.
            </p>
            <!-- Illustration -->

            </div>
            <p>
              This app also has quite a lot of form handling. And if you know about forms, they're not really fun to
              look at. The format can be a bit overwhelming and again, there a lack of clear visual hierarchy so it
              falls short of giving the user some guidance on where to start.
            </p>
            <p>
              Most of the app's input forms are also in a modal dialogue. Although modal dialogs are very effective in
              attracting a user's attention to focus on the task at hand, one downside is that the window goes away
              whenever the outside of the dialogue box is clicked and can be disruptive because the user would have to
              open the modal again to finish the task. A link for viewing and filling out notes which is a major
              caregiver task and contains a lot of input fields is also in a modal which is not ideal.

              After doing remote interviews with 5 caregivers, 5 admins and 2 of our Business Development Managers, I
              put together my research data by documenting transcripts from the recorded interviews and then did an
              affinity mapping. I organized the responses based on painpoints vs. needs and separated them according to
              user types. I then proceeded to further sort them by what feature or functionality the problem is about.
              By classifying information in this way, it was easier to identify problems and common issues. It was also
              easier to present it to stakeholders as it is more digestible.

              Without hours and notes input from the caregivers, the system will not be able to generate any data or

              the hours and note entry for caregivers and dashboard utilization for providers/admin.

              A mobile app for recording hours and notes is the best solution for caregivers so they can clock-in,

              desktop or laptop. Since caregivers are always on the go whether they are inside the clientâ€™s home or
              outside accompanying their clients to doctorâ€™s appointments, they can easily record their notes and hours.

            The design changes achieved our goal and cemented the viability of the product which ultimately helped the
            company to secure VC funding to take the product to its next phase. During usability testing, feedback from
            the customers were very positive regarding the improvements and were excited and looking forward to using
            the new app. By solving the usability problem, we also fed two birds with one scone.

          <p class="learnings">
            We sometimes become rooted to what we think our customers are interested in and assume that they will
            understand our product the way that we designed it. Before joining DocuMentor, features were implemented in
            isolation without getting customer's feedback and that resulted in poor customer adoption. After conducting
            interviews, users' feedback revealed that there were a lot of friction points with interactions on the
            dashboard and forms. And that's the reason why the caregivers are having a hard time using the app or they
            just don't use it at all. Listening to our customers not only gave me valuable insights but I also learned
            about how passionate the providers and caregivers are in giving care to their clients which inspired me more
            to help them solve their problems.

          <p class="learnings">
            Create a document as a single source of truth to ensure a seamless continuation of the product cycle so that
            if another designer takes over they wonâ€™t have a hard time looking for things. There is also great value in
            doing a version control of everything that you work on. Make sure that you don't overwrite changes in your
            design files so you or other people can see the progress and who knows, your explorations may have some
            value for another problem. I admit that I could have done a better job capturing everything especially ideas
            from brainstorming sessions. Documenting the discovery process should not be left behind.

            <p>Cross-functional collaboration is really helpful.</p>
          </div>
          <p class="learnings">
            Since I was the only UX Designer in the team, I relied on our developers for brainstorming and was able to
            bounce ideas off of them. Designers are not the only ones with great ideas, developers also have good ideas.
            Consulting with them early on is especially helpful to know how complex a feature or functionality will be.
            And by doing that, you can easily make adjustments before going full high-fidelity. Our business development
            team is a trove of valuable information. Because they give product demos, onboard our customers, and also
            find customers, they receive first-hand information from our customers about their struggles, needs and
            wants. I really learned a lot from them and had gotten valuable insights.
