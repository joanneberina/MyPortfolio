            DocuMentor is an electronic visit verification (EVV) solution used to verify visit activity for home health,
            home care and hospice.
          </p>
          <p>
            Electronic Visit Verification is a system for tracking work performed, hours, notes, accurate location
            information and much more about the patient-caregiver interaction, including information about the service
            provider. EVV applies to care and health services rendered in the home. The purpose of EVV is to ensure that
            services are delivered to people needing those services and that providers only bill for services rendered.

          <h2><span>🤔</span> Problem</h2>
          <p>
            Caregivers are not using the web app to clock their hours and record notes on the day of their workday but
            instead they are recording their hours and notes at a later date on paper which can be inaccurate and is
            sometimes submitted after the deadline. This makes it harder for providers and supervisors to track the
            caregivers hours which in turn causes delays on billing and reimbursement.

            The goal is to improve the flow and user experience by redesigning the user interface using Ant Design

            To be able to understand and relate to our customers and the team, it is essential to learn all about what
            EVV is and the industry that it serves. There were a lot of unfamiliar jargon and terminologies so talking
            to stakeholders, meeting with the developers and account managers was key to learning about how the app
            works and the current challenges that our customers were facing.
          </p>

          <p>
            Both the CEO and the development team suggested that a UI redesign is much needed. When I was evaluating the
            current state of the app, it was apparent that the dashboard for both the caregiver and admin didn't have a
            clear information hierarchy. For example, there were several clickable icons but did not have the affordance
            that it is a link. It also did not have a text label that goes with it and that can be frustrating for first
            time users.
          </p>

            </div>
          </div>
          <p>
            As the nature of EVV apps goes, this app also has quite a lot of form handling. And if you know about forms,
            they're not really fun to look at. The format looks a bit overwhelming and again, there's a lack of
            information hierarchy so it falls short of giving the user some guidance on where to start.
          </p>
          <p>
            Most of the app's input forms are also in a modal dialogue. Although modal dialogs are very effective in
            attracting a user's attention to focus on the task at hand, it has more disadvantages in the way that it is
            utilized in the app. One downside is that the window goes away whenever the outside of the dialogue box is
            clicked and that can be disruptive because the user would have to open the modal again to finish the task. A
            link for viewing notes is also in a modal as well as many other interactions.

            It was clear that there were usability issues but they will remain as assumptions without verifying it from
            our users. Customer interviews are the most effective way to get direct feedback and validate our
            assumptions based from the UX audit. I was also looking forward to unique insights and discoveries that I
            may come across during this process.

          <p>
            But before diving into user interviews, it is essential to have a UX research plan which will help set
            expectations and document the essentials needed to communicate to stakeholders and customers. I outlined the
            general user interview goals and specific user interview goals for each target user.

            After doing remote interviews with 5 caregivers, 5 admins and 2 of our Business Development Managers, I put
            together my research data by writing down transcripts from the recorded interviews. And then organize it by
            doing affinity mapping. I organized the responses based on painpoints vs. needs and separated them according
            to user types. I then proceeded to further sort them by what feature or functionality the problem is about.
            By classifying information in this way, it was easier to identify problems and common issues. It was also
            easier to present to stakeholders because it is more digestible.

            Establishing user and/or process flows is an essential step in the design process to help us understand how
            a user journey pans out and to determine the app's information architecture. There was no existing
            documentation for it so I collaborated with the stakeholders so we can come up with the caregiver and
            admin’s user flows. Mapping out the hours and notes submission process helped us identify the different
            stages that a session goes through and how it correlates to the caregiver's hours and notes submission.

            This was a surprising discovery for us and one that we didn’t really expect. It was a typical case of “you
            are not your user.” For the internet savvy generation, this might be a typical element of interaction but
            for our demographic, it was an unfamiliar symbol. The first symbol that we used was not the usual
            bread-meat-bread hamburger menu. We found that our users didn’t really know what the symbol meant. It also
            kind of looked like a logo so they didn’t know to click on it that‘s why we went back to the typical equal
            horizontal lines.

            Instead of showing just a list of the name of the vehicles that the user would need to click for them to see
            the details, we designed an interaction where all the details can be shown and hidden by
            expanding/collapsing each vehicle without going to another page.

            To help users remember what vehicle that they are routing with, we added some sort of breadcrumb so they can
            see the vehicle they are using for that route. It was also important to show the obstacles that are being
            avoided like low clearances and dirt roads so that the user is aware of the value they get when they use the
            app.

            When in doubt about how much the user will understand something or care about a certain feature, get their
            feedback and validate ideas. We would initialy rely on our assumptions but without validation from users, we
            might end up with a product that users are not gonna love or worse, not use at all. Users will always have a
            different perspective of what is useful and what is not.

            Getting feedback from teammates, especially the developers is also just as important. I think that if we
            involved our developers more with the ideation process or if we got feedback early on before we did a ton of
            work, we would have made informed design decisions because we would know if the solution we were designing
            can even be implemented or if the resources that are required are available.

              “The drive is not always about the destination. The sights in between are just as interesting. There’s
              lots of help finding where to go, but not the best way to get there in an RV”

            This quote from one of our interviewees really stuck with me. Traveling in an RV, like life, (and UX!) is
            not necessarily about the destination. The journey is just as valuable, and the fastest route is not always
            the best option. There’s something to be said for choosing the road less traveled. You never know what
            adventures you’ll find along the way!
