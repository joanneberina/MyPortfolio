            DocuMentor is an electronic visit verification (EVV) solution used to verify visit activity for home health,
            home care and hospice.
          </p>
          <p>
            Electronic Visit Verification is a system for tracking work performed, hours, notes, accurate location
            information and much more about the patient-caregiver interaction, including information about the service
            provider. EVV applies to care and health services rendered in the home. The purpose of EVV is to ensure that
            services are delivered to people needing those services and that providers only bill for services rendered.

              Because I'm doing a re-design, I wanted to first evaluate the current state of the app, learn about it's
              functionalities and all the features. What is does and what it doesn't do. It was apparent that the

              I did an affinity mapping by organizing responses based on painpoints and then further sort them by what

            friction points than we originally thought. Listening to our customers not only gave me valuable insights
            but I also learned about how passionate the providers and caregivers are in giving care to their clients
            which inspired me more to help them solve their problems.

            Create a document as a single source of truth for documentation and handoff is so valuable. There is also
            great value in doing a version control of the design that are created. When you don't overwrite changes in
            your design files, other people can see the progress. When you go back to your explorations you may find
            hidden gems that you might be able to use for something else. I definitely could have done a better job
            capturing everything especially ideas from brainstorming sessions. To be safe, just screenshot everything.

            Since I was the only UX Designer in the team, I relied on our developers for brainstorming and was able to
            bounce ideas off of them. Designers are not the only ones with great ideas, developers also have good ideas.
            Consulting with them early on is especially helpful to know how complex a feature or functionality will be.
            And by doing that, you can easily make adjustments before going full high-fidelity. Our business development
            team is a trove of valuable information. Because they give product demos, onboard our customers, and also
            find customers, they receive first-hand information from our customers about their struggles, needs and
            wants. I really learned a lot from them and had gotten valuable insights.
