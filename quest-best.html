            <p>
                Quest for the Best is a social challenge platform that encourages members of a community to seek out the best available experiences in their area. The underlying objective is to get community members to go outside and seek new experiences through “Quests”.

            <p class="subtitle">The Problem</p>
            <p>Create a simple and intuitive mobile app that will let users participate in "Quests" by having the ability to propose a quest to rate experiences. After signing up, a user can: propose a poll, start a quest, add crew members to the quest and be able to communicate with their crew through a chat feature. The scope of the challenge is to build the completed quest and chat feature.  I was the sole UX designer for this project and I was given one week to come up with a clickable high fidelity prototype.

        <section class="text-right">
            <p class="sidebar-title">DISCOVERY & DEFINITION</p>
            <p>While doing user interviews, most of the feedback is that users will find the app more enjoyable if they are doing it with friends. They also prefer to do this activity with someone they already know and people who are in the same city so that they can go together on the quests.</p>

            <p>The criteria are decided by participants of the quest so it can be very subjective. Coming to a consensus would be a challenge if the quests would be open to the  public and will be participated by people that don’t know each other. This situation can possibly cause friction which can lead to users abandoning the app.</p>

            <p>Based on these insights, I decided to make the quests private. I also decided to use the term “friends” instead of “crew members”.  Users can also do multiple quests at a time but each quest is limited to a specific city.

            <p class="subtitle">Competitive Research Insight</p>
            <p>Most popular mobile apps that I looked at have their navigation at the bottom. At first, I thought that this was a design trend. After looking into it, I learned the reason why. A research study has found that most users hold their phone with one hand. When they use their phones, they’ll use either the right or left thumb to interact with the screen. And since mobile phones have become bigger, the area of the screen that is not thumb-reachable has also increased. So if the navigation is mostly at the top of the screen, users will have to regrip their phones making it harder and slower. For that reason, whenever possible I limited navigation that is located at the top of the screen. </p>
