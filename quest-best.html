            <p>Quest for the Best is a social challenge platform that encourages members of a community to seek out the best available experiences in their area. The underlying objective is to get community members to go outside and seek new experiences through “Quests”.</p>

            <p class="subtitle">The Problem</p>
            <p>Create a simple and intuitive mobile app that will let users participate in "Quests" by having the ability to propose a quest to rate experiences. After signing up, a user can: propose a poll, start a quest, add crew members to the quest and be able to communicate with their crew through a chat feature. The scope of the challenge is to build the completed quest and chat feature.  I was the sole UX designer for this project and I was given one week to come up with a clickable high fidelity prototype.

                <p>DISCOVERY & DEFINITION</p>
            </div>
            <div class>
                <p>While doing user interviews, most of the feedback is that users will find the app more enjoyable if they are doing it with friends. They also prefer to do this activity with someone they already know and people who are in the same city so that they can go together on the quests.</p>
    
                <p>The criteria are decided by participants of the quest so it can be very subjective. Coming to a consensus would be a challenge if the quests would be open to the  public and will be participated by people that don’t know each other. This situation can possibly cause friction which can lead to users abandoning the app.</p>
    
                <p>Based on these insights, I decided to make the quests private. I also decided to use the term “friends” instead of “crew members”. Users can also do multiple quests at a time but each quest is limited to a specific city.

            <p class="subtitle">Competitive Research Insight</p>
            <p>Most popular mobile apps that I looked at have their navigation at the bottom. At first, I thought that this was a design trend. After looking into it, I learned the reason why. A research study has found that most users hold their phone with one hand. When they use their phones, they’ll use either the right or left thumb to interact with the screen. And since mobile phones have become bigger, the area of the screen that is not thumb-reachable has also increased. So if the navigation is mostly at the top of the screen, users will have to regrip their phones making it harder and slower. For that reason, whenever possible I limited navigation that is located at the top of the screen.</p>

        <section class="text-left white-space">
            <p class="subtitle-colored">IDEATION: PROTOTYPE</p>
            <p>The user logs in with a username and password. The sign-in button is inactive while there is no input. After logging in, the user is presented with a dashboard. The main content of the dashboard shows the ongoing poll and the user’s most recent quest. The header and footer are fixed, and navigation menu is on the bottom of the screen. The user can access Polls, Active Quests, Completed Quests and Chat on the tab navigation.</p>
        </section>

        <section class="text-center white-space">
            <p class="subtitle">Completed Quests</p>
            <p>All completed quests are displayed in cards. The cards show users what the result of the quest is. Clicking on the address pulls up maps. The user can see details about the completed quest by clicking on a card. Each completed quest shows the Quest winner and the contenders. And on each card, is information such as the name of the proposer, when the quest ended, the overall rating and also the rating of each category.</p>

            <p>There are no crud operations since I don’t see the value of deleting completed quests. If needed it would be better to archive it rather than delete it since users would want to keep a record of completing the quest, as a memento or a personal collection.</p>

            <p>I made use of the header as a breadcrumb to form a trail back to the previous page and also to show users where they are on the app. And of course, you can swipe left or right to go forward and back as another way to switch between pages.</p>

        <section class="text-center white-space">
            <p class="subtitle">Chat Feature</p>
            <p>The main content of the chat page is a list of channels that the user is currently in. On the chat page, the user can delete and add a channel. Similar to other messaging apps, the user can swipe left that will give the option to pin, mute or delete the channel. After clicking delete, a modal pop up confirming the action.</p>

            <p>The button for adding a channel is a fixed button. It is located near the bottom of the screen again, for easy access. So even if the list of channels becomes really long, the add button will stay in the same position.</p>

            <p>After typing the name of the channel, the add button is activated. Clicking the add button activates a drop-down option. So the idea here is that the user can add members of existing quests to a channel that they’re creating. I didn’t design the chat feature to be a very robust one in the sense that there is no direct messaging capability. The reason behind this is that since users are doing it with friends or people that they know, they can always send direct messages through text messaging or other messaging apps. I didn’t see the added value of having that functionality since the purpose of the app is not mainly for that. Limiting the chat functionality can also save development costs, which is something that stakeholders always want to hear.</p>

            <p>The chat messaging interface that I designed is very similar to the iPhone’s text messaging or facebook messenger. I chose this interface because most people are already familiar with so it is very little to no learning curve. Users can add more members and look at the details of this channel by clicking the channel title or icon. They can change preferences like turning notifications on and off, and there is an option to mute, pin or leave the channel. When adding members to the channel, the user will be able to choose from their friend's list. This list is populated by the friends that the user has added over time just like what you see on facebook.</p>
