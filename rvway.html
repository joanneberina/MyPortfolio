                <p>After getting the big RV picture, we wanted to learn more about the RV community, their needs and pain points to solve the problem: How might we help RV drivers safely get from point A to point B?

                <p>While doing surverys and user interviews, we learned that people driving an RV worry about things that wouldn’t normally be a concern for someone who drives a regular vehicle. We also wanted to know what features our users would like in a navigation app. These are the top responses from our users.</p>

            <div class="section-content">
                <p>After doing sketches and exploring ideas, we came up with an initial mobile solution that had all the bells and whistles - it was like Google maps. It has an option to search for a point of interest as a destination, add stops along the route, featureing auto-complete and geo-location. And of course, we designed it to have a turn-by-turn voice navigation.</p>

                </div>
                <p>But this was not the right solution because we learned later on that  we didn’t have the resources to get the right API that would provide the data for the points of interest. While all the initial features we designed were certainly “nice to haves”, it really did not directly impact the problem of safely routing the RV traveler from point A to point B. </p>

                <p>In a perfect world, providing all of these features and addressing all their pain points would be ideal.
